React Component Composition 

 - Allows for code reusability between component 
 - we build components from other components, of varying complexity and specialization through props
 - A higher-order component is another pattern of the React component composition model. 
 - It is just a function that takes in a component and creates a new, "enhanced" component from it.
 - It can be used when we have multiple components that may share some properties like functionality or data
